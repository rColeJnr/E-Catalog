My immediate question is, what's it doing in the curriculum in the first place?   It's a dreadful disservice to Mark Twain for teachers to push ''Huckleberry Finn'' on seventh-, eighth- and ninth-graders. I had it forced on me in 11th grade and, after the hair-raising opening passages about Huck's whisky-besotted ''Pap,'' found it tedious in the extreme. Thereafter I avoided it for years. It had been poisoned for me by schoolteachers who drove me to it before I was equipped to enjoy it.",

Years later, the regiment’s historian reported that the rebel “was loading them with imprecations of unique and vigorous character.” Seeing the lieutenant, the thieves retreated, and the Union officer was surprised to discover that he had come to the aid of none other than Brig.
