      "synopsis": "Naruto Uzumaki has finally achieved his dream of becoming Hokage, the leader of the Hidden Leaf Village that he spent his teenage years fighting to protect. Naruto and his peers now live in a world of peace, working hard to uphold an international truce built on good will and diplomacy. However, this stasis comes at a personal cost for the aging hero. Naruto and the shinobi he grew up alongside find that working to upkeep the neutral world takes them away from their families, and even the legendary warriors of Naruto's generation must contend with being mediocre parents to their bitter children, including his own son Boruto. Boruto Uzumaki faces a world completely unlike that of his father, finding unique trouble in the distance between the two. Contending with a society that heaps an unbearable load of pressure on his shoulders over his status as the Hokage's son, Boruto carves his own path through the world, fighting to make a name for himself as evil forces threaten to shatter the peace his father helped create.

One of these kids is Sarada Uchiha, daughter of Naruto's best friends Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Sharing a strong likeness with her father, Sarada has always wondered why she doesn't have any of her mother's features. When she discovers a photograph featuring Sasuke's old comrade Karin, Sarada is shocked to discover that she bears more of a resemblance to this strange woman than she does to her mother. When Sasuke returns to the village with news of a massive impending threat, Naruto obeys his duty as the Seventh Hokage and accompanies his old friend on an investigative mission. Unbeknownst to them both, Sarada and her friend Chouchou Akimichi pursue them, intent on solving the mystery of Sarada's parentage. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Squad Seven's latest job is a real snore—escorting a young, cowardly leader named Shibuki back to the remote Hidden Waterfall Village. They arrive without a problem, but get stuck cleaning the village pond! While Naruto and his pals pick up the trash, Kakashi is called back to his home village on urgent business. Then, without warning, a brilliant rogue ninja shows up in tow with his evil henchmen. Suien desperately desires the Hidden Waterfall's most precious possession, a secret potion called the Hero's Water. And as Squad Seven quickly discovers, the guy will do absolutely anything to get it! With their fearless sensei gone, Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura find themselves in the most deadly situation of their young lives. (Source: VIZ Media)",

Minato strives to create his own powerful technique to protect Kushina Uzumaki, the strong-willed woman he loves. Honoring Uzumaki clan tradition, Kushina's body hosts the nine-tailed fox spirit, Kurama. The demon seeks to break free from his confines and wreak havoc on the world. As Kushina struggles against Kurama's power and her own inner turmoil, Minato hurries to complete the Rasengan and save her from herself. [Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To prevent the world from being destroyed, the demon has to be sealed and the only one who can do it is the shrine maiden Shion from the country of demons, who has two powers; one is sealing demons and the other is predicting the deaths of humans. This time Naruto's mission is to guard Shion, but she predicts Naruto's death. The only way to escape it, is to get away from Shion, which would leave her unguarded, then the demon, whose only goal is to kill Shion will do so, thus meaning the end of the world. Naruto decides to challenge this \"prediction of death,\" but fails to prove Shion's prediction wrong and supposedly dies in vain. (Source: Wikipedia)",

      "synopsis": "Ten years ago, a gigantic demon beast known as the Nine-Tailed Demon Fox was released from its jinchuuriki by an unknown shinobi wearing a mask. The village of Konohagakure was close to destruction by the attack of the Nine-Tails, but the village was saved by its leader. Minato Namikaze and his wife Kushina Uzumaki—who was the jinchuuriki at the time of the attack—sealed away the demon inside their new born son: Naruto Uzumaki. However, this act of saving the village cost them their lives and they left the future of the ninja world to Naruto. With the demon fox sealed away, things continued as normal. However, the peace of the village would not last long, for Pain, Konan, Itachi Uchiha, Kisame Hoshigaki, Sasori, Deidara, Hidan and Kakuzu—members of a dreaded shinobi group called the Akatsuki—attacked Konohagakure. Naruto narrowly manages to launch a counter-attack but why have these shinobi appeared when all of them were meant to have died? The mystery remains, but the shinobi are praised by heir families for completing such a dangerous mission. However, one of them who has never known the faces of his parents, Naruto, cannot help but feel lonely. At that exact time, suddenly, the masked man makes his appearance in Konoha. Naruto and his allies are both attacked by the man's mysterious new doujutsu. (Source: Naruto Wikia)",
