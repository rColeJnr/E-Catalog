Rhett obliges. Thus does McCaig correct the record. In Margaret Mitchell’s telling — that is, in “Gone With the Wind” — we learn that Rhett has been arrested for killing “this darky who had insulted a white woman.” A few chapters later, Rhett confesses his guilt to Scarlett O’Hara, the other half of Mitchell’s famous romantic pair. “What else could a Southern gentleman do?” he asks.",

I mean his own opening nights, when a ''Guys and Dolls'' or a ''How to Succeed'' was about to unleash itself upon polite society. The rules for opening nights insist that the author -whether he wrote the whole shebang or perhaps just the libretto - be, for the moment, The Invisible Man.   He is not supposed to be out on the sidewalk, watching the stretch limousines disgorge their unrecognizable celebrities. He is not even supposed to be just outside the stage door, taking a forbidden drag on a cigarette and nodding nervously at total strangers.",

In this resolutely old-fashioned Navy tale, a selfish, hard-hearted loner becomes a much, much better man, thanks to the rigors of basic training and the love of a good woman. Undeniably, there's an element of corniness to this. But that doesn't keep ''An Officer and a Gentleman'' from being a first-rate movie - a beautifully acted, thoroughly involving romance. If this summer hasn't previously had a wonderful Hollywood love story to call its own, it has one now.",

        "abstract": "\"THE GENTLEMAN TRAMP,\" opening today at the New Yorker and other theaters, is an authorized documentary devoted to the life of Charlie Chaplin. The film, which was made sometime before the great man's death last year, carries the information that \"every frame, from rough cut to final version, has been checked and approved personally by Charles Chaplin.\" Like all authorized biographies, it's somewhat too pious for its own good humor.The film was directed, written and edited by Richard Patterson, who worked with Peter Bogdanovich on the 1972. Oscar salute to Chaplin, footage of which is the true climax of the picture. Most of the film is devoted to scenes (many splendid ones) taken from 17 Chaplin comedies, including \"City Lights,\" \"The Gold Rush,\" \"Modern Times\" and \"The Kid.\"There's an attempt to recapitulate highlights of Chaplin's life—both good times and bad—with newsreel footage, as well as with still photographs, some of which are accompanied by lofty quotations from Chaplin's book, \"My Autobiography.\" The quotations, read by Laurence Olivier, come off worse on film than they do on the printed page: \"In Philadelphia I discovered Emerson,\" says Chaplin, meaning, I suppose, Ralph Waldo. As in \"My Autobiography,\" there's also a good deal of name—or photograph—dropping, to prove that Charlie hobnobbed with swells of his time, including Lloyd George, Winston Churchill and George Bernar Shaw.Some of the film is dreadful, as when we hear a gossip-columnist, who sounds like Hedda Hopper, as she attacks Charlie, but a lot of the comedy footage is still fun, even if out of context. The nicest moments, though, are the home movies in which we see the elderly Charlie and his wife, Oona. They seem to have been a truly happy couple.",
